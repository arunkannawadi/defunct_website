<p align="justify"> Gauss-Hermite polynomials (also known as shapelets) form a set of localised, complete basis functions that can in principle capture the complex morphology of galaxies. However, in the presence of features, such as spiral arms or knots, this basis function may not be very effective in practice. Moreover, the pixel noise in the images forbid the inference of higher order coefficients reliably. Instead, compound shapelets consisting of shapelets of multiple shapes (and centroids) can represent a complex galaxy more effectively. It may be seen as a generalisation of a 2-D Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Using this overcomplete basis as a Dictionary, we can decompose any given galaxy by imposing sparsity constraint. We then aim to develop a generative model of realistic galaxy images by training on the galaxy images in Nearby Galaxy Catalog (NGC). This has some advantages over Deep Learning methods, in that the seeing can be treated separately. </p>
