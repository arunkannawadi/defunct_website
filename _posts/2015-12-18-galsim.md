In this work, we highlight the shortcomings of using a deep narrow sample as a training sample to obtain redshift-dependent shear calibration biases for large surveys.
Using COSMOS catalog, which is the largest contiguous survey from the Hubble Space Telescope, we showed that individual redshift bins were dominated by a single (or few) overdensities and voids.
Thus, they cannot be used to obtain the redshift-dependent calibration for shear estimates since the sample is dominanted by local environment and is not a representative sample of the Universe.
We tried a few possible techniques to mitigate this effect, but nonetheless, the environment effects were too strong to obtain a useful training sample from COSMOS.
